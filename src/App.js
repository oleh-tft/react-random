          <div className='comment'>The Lost Daughters of Ukraine took my breath away. This heart-wrenching novel is the story of three women whose lives are forever changed by the terrors their families and their homeland endured during WWII. There are passages and scenes in this book that are very hard to readâ€”honest and raw accounts of the horrors of war, and especially the suffering and brutality that were unique to Ukraine.</div>
